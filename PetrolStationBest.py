'''
 * One of version of the gasoline puzzle due to Lovasz.
 * On a very long, circular, isolated driving route there are a number of small
 * gas stations, each with a limited supply of gasoline left.
 * First, check out if in total gas stations contain exactly the amount of gasoline
 * needed to get a car around one full circuit.
 * If it's true, prove that, starting with an empty tank, there is some station
 * we can start at which will allow us to complete one trip around the route.
 * Of course, we will be collecting gasoline whenever we pass a station.
 * Assume a carâ€™s tank is large enough to hold as much as necessary,
 * and that no other cars will be taking any of the available gasoline.
